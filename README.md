# 🤖🍽️ Fine Dine – React Native Mobile Application

## Overview

**Fine Dine Mobile Application** is a cross-platform React Native application developed as part of an autonomous waiter robot and smart restaurant system. The mobile app provides both **customer-side functionality** and an **admin panel**, enabling seamless interaction between customers, restaurant staff, and the waiter robot through cloud-based IoT integration.

The application is designed to work alongside the Fine Dine web application and serves as a core control and management platform within the robot-assisted dining ecosystem.

## Role in the Waiter Robot & IoT System

The mobile application plays a dual role in the system:

### 👤 Customer Side

* Browse the digital restaurant menu
* Place food orders using a mobile device
* Orders are synced in real time with the waiter robot via Firebase

### 🛠️ Admin Panel

* Manage menu items and availability
* Monitor incoming customer orders
* Support robot-assisted food delivery operations

The mobile app acts as a **bridge between users and the autonomous waiter robot**, leveraging cloud services for real-time communication.
